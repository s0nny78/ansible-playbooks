### Description

This is a list of my playbook.
If you came here because you used my stack :
* [AWS/README.md] (https://github.com/s0nny78/AWS)

"host" is the playbook used for Ansible Server to configure its own host file 

"tomcat" is the one deployed to others hosts to install tomcat8, and put clojure collector
